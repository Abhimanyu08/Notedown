3. Allow users to embed executable, non-executable code blocks 
4. Migrate to Next13 (major)
5. refactor htmlToJsx, getting really hard to maintain.
6. Allow talking to the blog post or summarizing at least (using langchain?)
7. Add support for codesandboxes.
8. Write lots and lots of posts(major)
9. Steal some ideas from https://ped.ro/writing/code-blocks-but-better
10. Something really really cool would be if I allow users to write mdx on the /edit page. Very hard to get that working though. We'll see.
11. need to take more control over markdown -> html conversion.
12. Figure out rss thing.

## Minor annoyances:
1. when someone pressed alt-p to go from preview -> edit he has to click on the editor to focus on it again. What's the point of using vim then lol.

2. 2 code blocks one after other merge into one another.
