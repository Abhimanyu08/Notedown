3. Allow users to embed executable, non-executable code blocks 
4. Migrate to Next13 (major)
5. refactor htmlToJsx, getting really hard to maintain.
6. Allow talking to the blog post or summarizing at least (using langchain?)
7. Add support for codesandboxes.
8. Write lots and lots of posts(major)
9. Steal some ideas from https://ped.ro/writing/code-blocks-but-better
10. Something really really cool would be if I allow users to write mdx on the /edit page. Very hard to get that working though. We'll see.
11. need to take more control over markdown -> html conversion.
12. Figure out rss thing.
13. Allow users to configure the og/display images for their blog posts. Give them a option to generate one using lexica or openai.
14. Huge huge scope for code improvements

## Minor annoyances:

2. 2 code blocks one after other merge into one another.
3. There's no confirmation of some kind when one published or unpublished a post
4. Modals are inconsistent with the website design
5. Upvoted by you section is ugly.
6. Design is all over the place.



## Done:
